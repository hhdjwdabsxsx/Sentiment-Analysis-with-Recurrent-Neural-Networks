# Sentiment Analysis with Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to perform sentiment analysis using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing (NLP) task that classifies text data into predefined sentiments, such as positive, negative, or neutral. RNNs are particularly suited for this task as they excel at processing sequential data.

---

## Features
- Preprocessing text data for sentiment analysis.
- Training an RNN model for text classification.
- Using the trained model to predict sentiments for new data.
- Evaluation metrics to measure model performance.

---

## Installation

1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## Dataset
The project uses a pre-existing dataset for sentiment analysis. Example datasets include:
- IMDb movie reviews dataset.
- Twitter sentiment datasets.

Ensure the dataset is in a CSV format with text and label columns. Place the dataset in the `data/` directory.

---

## Usage

### 1. Preprocessing
Preprocess the dataset to clean and tokenize the text data:
```bash
python preprocess.py
```

### 2. Training
Train the RNN model on the preprocessed data:
```bash
python train.py
```

### 3. Testing
Evaluate the model's performance on test data:
```bash
python test.py
```

### 4. Prediction
Use the trained model to predict sentiments for new text inputs:
```bash
python predict.py --text "This is a great movie!"
```

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- TensorFlow or PyTorch
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

Install the dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Results
The trained RNN model achieves an accuracy of approximately 85% on the test dataset. The performance can be further improved by:
- Hyperparameter tuning.
- Using advanced architectures like LSTMs or GRUs.
- Leveraging pre-trained word embeddings (e.g., GloVe or Word2Vec).
